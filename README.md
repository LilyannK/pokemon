# Pokemon
The current program takes in the `pokemon tcg API` and uses it to find evey instance of a latias or latios card and puts in into an excell sheet. This is for my personal collecting purposes to collect all of the latias and latios cards because they are my favorite pokemons. 
# API KEY
just add the actual API key when running it locally im not leaking mine
